<p>Handshake is a UTXO-based blockchain protocol which manages the registration, renewal and transfer of DNS top-level domains (TLDs). Our naming protocol differs from its predecessors in that it has no concept of namespacing or subdomains at the consensus layer. Its purpose is <em>not</em> to replace DNS, but to replace the root zone file and the root servers.</p>
<p>The full node daemon, <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hskd">hskd</a>, is written in Javascript and is a fork of <a href="https://bcoin.io">bcoin</a>. By running a full node you, you can participate in securing the network and serving the root zone file embedded in the blockchain.</p>
<p>We also have a SPV client, <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hnsd">hnsd</a>, which is written in C. It acts as a light client to the blockchain, as well as a recursive name server. It can serve provable resource records and verify payments without having the resource requirements of a full node.</p>
<p>By installing Handshake, you are participating in a decentralized open platform owned by the commons.</p>

<p>API documentation for hskd can be found <a href="https://handshake-org.github.io/docs/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="security-audit">Security Audit</h2>
<p>The protocol and implementation are being audited by a team led by <a href="https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/">Dr. Matthew Green</a> of John Hopkins University. Dr. Green has previously led audits on the <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/08/libsodium-v1-0-12-and-v1-0-13-security-assessment/">libsodium</a> crypto library and the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/04/02/truecrypt-report/">Truecrypt</a> disk encryption project. He is also a co-author of both the <a href="http://zerocoin.org/talks_and_press">Zerocoin</a> and <a href="http://zerocash-project.org/paper">Zerocash</a> papers. He is also a research scientist for the <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash Company</a> and shares his thoughts on cryptographic engineering on his <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/">blog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="coins">Coins</h2>
<p>Handshake utilizes a utility coin system for name registration. Handshake depends on the free and open source community to take ownership and decentralize the system <a href="https://handshake.org" class="uri">https://handshake.org</a>.</p>
