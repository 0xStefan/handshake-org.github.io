<!-- <section class="markdown-body"><h2 id="about-handshake">About Handshake</h2>
<p>Handshake is a UTXO-based blockchain protocol which manages the registration, renewal and transfer of DNS top-level domains (TLDs). Our naming protocol differs from its predecessors in that it has no concept of namespacing or subdomains at the consensus layer. Its purpose is <em>not</em> to replace DNS, but to replace the root zone file and the root servers.</p>
<p>The full node daemon, <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hskd">hskd</a>, is written in Javascript and is a fork of <a href="https://bcoin.io">bcoin</a>. By running a full node you, you can participate in securing the network and serving the root zone file embedded in the blockchain.</p>
<p>We also have a SPV client, <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hnsd">hnsd</a>, which is written in C. It acts as a light client to the blockchain, as well as a recursive name server. It can serve provable resource records and verify payments without having the resource requirements of a full node.</p>
<p>By installing and/or contributing to Handshake, you are participating in a decentralized open platform owned by the commons.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>We have installation instructions for <a href="/install-linux.html">Linux</a>, <a href="/install-mac.html">macOS</a>, and <a href="/install-win.html">Windows</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: the software works best with unix-like OSes, and has not yet been thoroughly tested on Windows. The BSDs and Solaris have also not been tested yet, but should work in theory.</p>
