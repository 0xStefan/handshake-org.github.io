## What is Handshake?

Handshake is an free/open source project that aims to replace the
centralized control of the domain name system (DNS) with an open, secure
and permission-less setup. We want to jump-start this project with the
necessary economic coordination for such a crucial, long-term endeavor
baked in.

To this end, we have raised approximately \$10 million USD from
[supporters](supporters.html) which we\'re distributing to fellow
[free/open source projects and organizations](organizations.html).

We\'re also making 75% of the genesis tokens for a new cryptocurrency
available to free/open source contributors. [**Signing
up**](http://beta.hndshk.net/signup) is easy, and after verifying your
GitHub account, freenode username and email address you can claim your
tokens.

## Getting started

-   hskd is the Handshake Daemon
-   We have a bunch of other useful utilities and things on our [GitHub
    profile](https://github.com/handshake-org) --- patches, suggestions
    and more all welcome!
-   We\'re on IRC! Free and open communication doesn\'t belong in some
    Slack channel you have to beg to join. Find us in \#handshake on
    freenode.
